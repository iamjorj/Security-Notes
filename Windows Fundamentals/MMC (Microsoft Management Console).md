## What is MMC

- groups administrative tools
	- manage hardware, software, network components
- runs on all windows versions

## Snap-ins
- allows admins to create a customized console with only the required administrative tools to do stuff
- can be added to local and remote systems
- these tools are then distributed to users, with only the required admin tools

## How to use

- open mmc (no shit)
- File --> Add or remove Snap-ins
- choose whether it manages the local computers, or another computer on the network
- we can save the set of snap-ins as a .msc file
